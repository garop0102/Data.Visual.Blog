For example, the variable pf_religion is the personal freedom rating for religion, while pf_religion_suppression is the personal freedom rating for religious organization repression, which is a subcategory for freedom of religion.\nThe variables of interests that will potentially be utilized is hf_score, hf_rank, pf_rol_criminal, pf_movement_vdem, pf_movement_vdem_women, pf_assembly_parties, pf_expression_vdem, pf_identity_same, pf_ss_disappearances_fatalities, ef_government_investment, and pf_ss_homicide.\nThe questions of interests that will be investigated will be, “Which countries had the greatest change in overall ranking from 2000 to 2021?”, and “What overall insights can we obtained from the HFI data set?”.\n\nData Context\nThe data set utilized for this analysis is from the Human Freedom Index 2023 (HFI), which provides a comprehensive measurement of personal, civil, and economic freedom across the world. It was developed by Ian Vásquez, Fred McMahon, Ryan Murphy, and Guillermina Sutter Schneider.The HFI was co-published by the Cato Institute and the Fraser Institute. The HFI incorporated 86 distinct variables spanning areas such as rule of law, security, economic freedom, and civil liberties. Covering 165 jurisdictions representing 98.8% of the world’s population, the index offered insights into the state of freedom worldwide from the year 2000 to 2021 for a total of 3630 observations. All of the data likely is incorporated from an analysis of surveys, legal documents, and expert reports. The data set can be accessed for more information at Human Freedom Index 2023."

Also worth noting, the Middle East & North Africa region is seen to have a steady decrease in ranking. The East Asian region is also in a decrease albeit a slight and minimal one. It would be interesting to explore the factors contributing to these contrasting trends.\n\n\nChange in Freedom Scores in Russia and United States\n\nfreedom_us &lt;- freedom |&gt; filter(countries == \"United States\") |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = c(\"pf_movement_vdem_women\", \"ef_government_investment\",\"pf_rol_criminal\",\"pf_ss_homicide\"), names_to = \"variables\", values_to = \"scores\") |&gt; relocate(\"scores\", \"variables\") |&gt; filter(!is.na(scores))\n\nus_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = freedom_us, aes(x = year, y = scores)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~variables,  ncol= 2) + theme_bw() + labs(title = \"United States Freedom Scores\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Freedom Index Score\", subtitle = \"Higher is Better!\")\n\n\nfreedom_ru &lt;- freedom |&gt; filter(countries == \"Russia\") |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = c(\"pf_movement_vdem_women\", \"ef_government_investment\",\"pf_rol_criminal\",\"pf_ss_homicide\"), names_to = \"variables\", values_to = \"scores\") |&gt; relocate(\"scores\", \"variables\") |&gt; filter(!is.na(scores))\n\nrus_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = freedom_ru, aes(x = year, y = scores)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~variables,  ncol= 2) + theme_bw() + labs(title = \"Russian Freedom Scores\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Freedom Index Score\",subtitle = \"Higher is Better!\")\nus_plot\n\n\n\nrus_plot\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot you can see the freedom of movement rating for women pf_movement_vdem_women, is consistently at 10 for the US, while in Russia the rating is still relatively high but more recently is slightly declining. This variable takes into account legal and social restrictions on movement as well as safety concerns and economic opportunities granted to women.\nThe variable ef_government_investment, represents the economic freedom rating for government investment, it focuses on how government spending impacts economic freedom. It values the score based on whether or not the government spending investments are free of corruption and transparent, if the government investment creates an unfair market, and if the government investment promote sustainable economic growth. There’s a lot of variability in the score for this variable in both countries! The US is seen to have a steady decline in scores in the mid to late 2000’s but has steadily shown improvement in the 2010s and into the 2020s. While in Russia the pattern is similar just more dramatic. Russia scored really badly in the early 2000s but picks up in the mid 2000s. The improvement is not linear but the over time, the score improves. A high score on this variable would indicate that government investments are done in a way that minimizes deceit and makes for a healthy business climate.\npf_rol_criminal is the personal freedom rating for protection from criminal activity or fair treatment under the law (ROL refers to Rule of Law). The variable is scored upon, police effectiveness, fairness of the judicial system, as well as overall public access to justice. The scores for the US simply hover around 6, while the score for Russia is in a steady decline, now hovering around a score of 2.5. A high score indicate that people feel secure from crime and have confidence that the legal system will treat them fairly.\nThe pf_ss_homicide variable is a personal freedom score for safety and security, specifically dealing with homicide rates. The variable takes into account the homicides rates and deaths that aren’t related to war or self-defense. In Russia, the homicide score is extremely low in the early 2000s. However an interesting trend is that over time the score rapidly increases, hitting a plateau from 2010 - 2015. The US on the other hand, has maintained a score hovering around 8.5 throughout the past 20 years. It is worth noting though, that there is a noticeable recent decline in homicide scores in the US. The most recent score of 8 in 2021 is the lowest it’s ever been in 20 years.\n\n\nTop 20 countries for Overall Human Freedom Index Score for 2021\n\nfreedom_top20 &lt;- freedom |&gt;\n  group_by(countries) |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2021) |&gt;\n  reframe(hf_score) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(hf_score)) |&gt;\n  mutate(countries = fct_reorder(.f = countries, .x = hf_score)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:20)\n\nggplot(data = freedom_top20, aes(x = countries, y = hf_score)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(x = countries, xend = countries, y = 0, yend = hf_score, color = hf_score), linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = hf_score), size = 4, alpha = 2) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() + labs(title = \"Top 20 Human Freedom Scores in 2021\", x = \"Countries\", y = \"Human Freedom Score\") + \n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(name = \"scale\")\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot it’s obvious that Switerland holds the highest overall Human Freedom Index Score for the year 2021 (9.01 / 10). With Czech Republic landing in the 20th place with a score of 8.38 / 10.\n\n\nBottom 20 countries for Overall Human Freedom Index Score for 2021\n\nfreedom_last20 &lt;- freedom |&gt;\n  group_by(countries) |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2021) |&gt;\n  reframe(hf_score) |&gt;\n  arrange((hf_score)) |&gt;\n  mutate(countries = fct_reorder(.f = countries, .x = hf_score)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:20)\n\nggplot(data = freedom_last20, aes(x = countries, y = hf_score)) + \n  geom_segment(aes(x = countries, xend = countries, y = 0, yend = hf_score, color = hf_score), linewidth = 1.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = hf_score), size = 4, alpha = 2) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() + labs(title = \"Bottom 20 Human Freedom Scores in 2021\", x = \"Countries\", y = \"Human Freedom Score\") + \n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = \"dashed\"), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(name = \"scale\")\n\n\n\n\nOut of the last 20 in Human Freedom Index Scores, Cameroon is at top with a score of 5.30 / 10. And last on the list is Syria with a score of 2.96 / 10."

    "text": "Conclusion\nSome limitations to consider regarding my approach to the Human Freedom Index (HFI) data set can be focused on data availability and a limited scope. The HFI takes data from all different kinds of sources. Doing this leaves to question the quality and comprehensiveness of the data since each source is different. I also could provide a bit more information into the variability of the overall scores and how much change has occurred on average to those scores. Also, aspects of such as health, income, environment quality, and education could have been taken into account.\nThe directions I could go with this data set is truly endless. For one, I could explore deeper the many other variables that were accounted for in the data set, 146 in total. I could also incorporate additional information regarding these countries to see if there are any patterns with scores and other factors such as education or health."

In total this data set contained 1692 total observations, each one being a different air strike.\nAs of my question of interest, I’ll be investigating the question, “Are there areas in the experiencing more civilian harm than others?”\n\nData Context\nThe data was obtained from Github (https://dronewars.github.io/data/). The data was gathered from a collection of news reports, statements, documents, press releases, images, and videos from national and international outlets. All this information was obtained through The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, an independent and non-profit organization.\nThe air strikes in the data are from the time period of November 3, 2002 - November 25, 2018. The data set provided insights into the geographic distribution of drone strikes across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen.\nThe data set also records the number of casualties resulting from air strikes, categorizing them as civilian(innocent or children) or militant."

Especially from particularly in conflict zones where access to information is restricted. Also, the map and time series plot focus on specific variables such as civilian casualties and their trends over time. But, it is pretty limited in providing a comprehensive understanding of the broader impact of drone warfare. Such as the emotional toll, the economic effects, and the long term injuries and illnesses that civilians are more likely to endure.\nIn the future I could incorporate more analysis and contextual information to provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing civilian casualties in drone warfare.

The time series plot enables comparison of different countries by visualizing trends of civilian casualties per 100 militants over time. This helps facilitate a effective way to do comparisons between regions and time periods.\nSimilarly, the map visualization presents spatial data in a clear and readable fashion, displaying the geographical distribution of average civilian casualties per 100 militants across different countries. The use of color gradients emphasizes areas with higher or lower levels of civilian harm, allowing for easy comparison between regions and highlighting regional disparities.

The Insomnia distribution seems to also have a minimal right skew and the OCD distribution has an obvious right skew.\n\nmusic_plot &lt;- music_health |&gt;\n  group_by(`Fav genre`) |&gt;\n  filter(n() &gt;= 25, !is.na(`Music effects`)) |&gt;\n  mutate(positive_ind = if_else(`Music effects` == \"Improve\", 1,0)) |&gt;\n  summarise(positive_prop = sum(positive_ind)/ n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(positive_prop)) |&gt; \n  mutate(`Fav genre` = fct_reorder(.f = `Fav genre`, .x = positive_prop))\n\nggplot(data = music_plot, aes(x = `Fav genre`, y = positive_prop)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightyellow\", color = \"darkgreen\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(y = \"Proportion of People Reporting\\nPositive Music Effect\", x = \"Genre\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\nIn genres that were listed as a favorite by 25 or more people, hip-hop had the highest proportion of people reporting that they had like felt their mental health had improved because of the music. On the contrary, people who had video game music as their favorite genre, reported the lowest proportion in the group.\n\nggplot(data = music_effect |&gt; filter(!is.na(`Music effects`)), aes(x = `Music effects`, y = Score)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = `Mental Condition`), alpha = 0.7, coef = 0.1) + scale_fill_viridis_d() + theme_minimal() + ylim(0,10.5) + labs(x = \"Music Effect on Mental Health\", y = \"Self-Reported Score\")\n\n\n\n\nThe box plot shows that for the people who reported that their mental health improved because of music, they scored anxiety as their highest. On the contrary, the plot suggests that for people who reported that their mental health had worsen, they scored depression highest. From this, I conclude that perhaps anxiety can be effectively treated with some music for individuals."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIt’s important to understand with this post and research that there are some flaws. One of them being that their is no control for factors that could effect mental health like, stress, hours spent sleep, and social support. Also, all of the respondents are self-diagnosing for conditions that require professional evaluation.\nIn the future, if additional data was present, the prospect of creating a model to predict mental health scores is intriguing to me. I could also explore the question if certain music genres had more effect on specific mental health conditions. For example, I could explore if folk music has more of an effect on anxiety than hip-hop."

    "text": "Connection to Class\nThe distribution of mental health scores for each condition is crucial for establishing a deeper understanding of the data and the visualizations that follow. Graphing the distribution, helps readers understand the variability in the data and identifying trends.\nAll the graphs I believe do a fair job at allowing the audience to make easy comparisons between the groups. The control for the sample size of people reporting a specific genre as their favorite in the second plot is important as well. I also think the third plot incorporates the idea of expressing variability in visualizations to give the audience a better view of outliers and their potential effects."
