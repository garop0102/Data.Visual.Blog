In total the data set holds 736 observations, each one being an individual who completed the survey.\n\nThe question of interest investigated will be, \"Did music improve the mental health conditions of these respondents?\n\n### Data Context\n\nOriginally, the data was collected by Catherine Rasgaitis, who used a Google Form. The form was posted across social media platforms such as, Reddit and Discord. Posters and business cards were displayed and handed out the public in libraries, parks, and other public locations. The author of the data is Catherine Rasgaitis, who studies Computer Science at the University of Washington. The data was collected from 07/27/2022 - 11/08/2022. From individuals from all over the world. \n\nFrom that point, the data made it's way onto Kaggle.com, where I got a hold of it. The following URL is the main page of the data set, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results. \n\n## Visualizatons\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Histogram of mental health variables \nmusic_effect <- music_health |>\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, OCD), names_to = \"Mental Condition\", values_to = \"Score\")\nggplot(data = music_effect, aes(x = `Score`)) + geom_histogram(fill = \"gold\", color = \"black\", bins = 8) + facet_wrap(~`Mental Condition`) + theme_bw() + labs(y = \"Total Count\", title = \"Distribution of Mental Health Scores\\nAcross Different Conditions\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the histograms, you can see that the Depression and Anxiety distributions are nearly even, except for a slight left skew in Anxiety. The Insomnia distribution seems to also have a minimal right skew and the OCD distribution has an obvious right skew. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmusic_plot <- music_health |>\n  group_by(`Fav genre`) |>\n  filter(n() >= 25, !is.na(`Music effects`)) |>\n  mutate(positive_ind = if_else(`Music effects` == \"Improve\", 1,0)) |>\n  summarise(positive_prop = sum(positive_ind)/ n()) |>\n  arrange(desc(positive_prop)) |> \n  mutate(`Fav genre` = fct_reorder(.f = `Fav genre`, .x = positive_prop))\n\nggplot(data = music_plot, aes(x = `Fav genre`, y = positive_prop)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightyellow\", color = \"darkgreen\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(y = \"Proportion of People Reporting\\nPositive Music Effect\", x = \"Genre\") +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn genre's that were listed as a favorite by 25 or more people, hip-hop had the highest proportion of people reporting that they had like felt their mental health had improved because of the music. On the contrary, people who had video game music as their favorites, reported the lowest proportion in the group. \n\n\n",
